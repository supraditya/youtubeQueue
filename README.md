# Youtube Queue

An experimental youtube playlist creator without using the YouTube API. (Deployed at: https://supraditya.github.io/youtubeQueue)

- Type in a song you want to listen to (the artist name along with it
  will yield better results) _e.g: "Aerochord-surface" or
  "Clans-alibi"_ and press enter.
- The _"I'm feeling lucky"_ search operation will be performed via
  DuckDuckGo's url parameters and if successful, should take you
  directly to the correct youtube result.

**Current build only allows for searching, but I plan to implement
playlist ordering and queuing without leaving the webpage in the
future.**

## To Run on LocalHost:

- Open terminal, enter node server.js
- Go to http://localhost:8080/
