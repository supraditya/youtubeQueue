# Youtube Queue
An experimental youtube playlist creator without using the YouTube API. (Deployed at: https://supraditya/github.io/youtubeQueue)

 - Type in a song you want to listen to (the artist name along with it
   will yield better results) *e.g: "Aerochord-surface" or
   "Clans-alibi"* and press enter. 
 - The *"I'm feeling lucky"* search operation will be performed via
   DuckDuckGo's url parameters and if successful, should take you
   directly to the correct youtube result.
 
 **Current build only allows for searching, but I plan to implement
   playlist ordering and queuing without leaving the webpage in the
   future.**
